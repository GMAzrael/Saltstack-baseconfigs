##WGET config initialization file

## Global settings (useful for setting up in /etc/wgetrc).
## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
##
quota = inf
tries = 20
reclevel = 5
passive_ftp = on
waitretry = 10
robots = on
wait = 1
dirstruct = off
recursive = off
backup_converted = on
#follow_ftp = off
use_proxy = on
http_proxy = http://proxy.corp.org.com:80
https_proxy = https://proxy.corp.org.com:80
